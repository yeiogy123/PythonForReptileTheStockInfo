# Remote-work
I finished the exam of three project of the part I, including 1, 2 , 4.
I used the way of BeautifulSoup with Request of Python API in order to reptile the target website, and finally output the data of the stock in the json form.
The third require that input the inteval of the date to get the data without using Selenium was a little bit difficult to me, I tried my best to search the data on the website but still cannot find a good way to fix it.
Though I didn't fulfill the request of the exam of PartI, but I still could learn more and more with an enthusiasticed heart for coding.
Hope I can get this work and finally be more strong on typing skill for different programming language.
If I have any problem in this work in the future, I will try my best to fix it or try to ask my boss or other.
I won't give up, cause that is my personality. 
Thanks for watching my project.
